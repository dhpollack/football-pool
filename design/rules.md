# Rules

## GENERAL RULES.

1. The pool consists each persons entry fee of $40 for 18 weeks of the season to be paid in **advance**. Please send them in early. $18 ($1 per week) will go to the pot for a single week and $16 will be contributed to an overall season pot. $3 will go to the Survivor Pool (See Below). An additional $3 goes to the *Rules Committee Fund* to cover expenses.
2. A player who does not comply with the rules may be ineligible to win any prizes.
3. In such a case as the rules do not encompass a particular situation, the Rules Committee will determine the outcome.

## HOW TO PLAY

1. The "picks" will be available each week, typically following the Monday Night game, but later if necessary. You must visit the site and complete the "pick sheet" **before** the beginning of **any** game listed on the "pick sheet". I.e. when that coin is tossed for the first game of the week, the pick sheet entry form becomes unavailable, **ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, NO EXCEPTIONS, NO WAY**, so get them in early. I know some of you think you might gain a tactical advantage by waiting till the last minute to get your picks in, but let me refer you to the distribution of previous years results and you will realize that you have about the same chance as a chimpanzee. So get them in early, I am not responsible for technical difficulties which can and do occur. The longer you wait the better chance you have of missing the week. Also, it is a good idea to click on the pick sheet button again after your picks are submitted to verify that they were received.
2. Teams on the left are favored over teams on the right. The point spread is listed to the right. Select the team by clicking on the radio button (little circle) to the left of the desired team.
3. The blanks on the right are where you rank your picks. Assign the highest number to the pick you are most certain of , and the lowest number to the pick of which you are least certain. The numbers assigned should range from one (1) to the number of games listed (i.e. one (1) to sixteen (16) if there are sixteen games). No number may be repeated.
4. The "Total score in Monday night game" is where you guess the sum of the two teams scores at the end of the Monday night game. This score is relevant only in the event of a tie. A tie will go to the player with the closest "total score" to Monday nights total score. If two or more players are tied for closest score they split the pot. Note, if there is more than one game being played on Monday night, only the game with the latest starting time is the game that will be used in case of a tie.
5. If you are still eligible, you need to chose a team for the Survivor Pool (See Below). Click on the down arrow next to the "Select Team" prompt under Survivor Pool and you will get a drop down list of the teams available to you. Click on the team you wish to select it.
6. Pressing the "Quick Pick"" button will fill out the pick sheet with randomly generated picks and ranks by the computer. It will also pick a random tiebreaker score in the range of 17 to 52. After pressing the "Quick Pick" button, you may modify your picks and/or the tiebreaker score before pressing the Submit button. It will also randomly select a Survivor Pool team if you are eligible. Note that pressing the "Quick Pick" button does NOT submit your picks, it merely fills out the form. You must STILL press the SUBMIT button at the bottom of the form to submit your picks. Note that you may make changes to the picks BEFORE pressing the SUBMIT button.

## SCORING

1. A pick is "correct" if (a) you picked the favorite and the favorite covered the point spread, or (b) you picked the underdog and the underdog won or lost but the favorite did not cover the point spread. If the favorite just makes the point spread, the game is considered a "push" and you will receive points equal to one half of the rank assigned to that game. Your score is calculated by adding the ranks assigned for each "correct" pick and 1/2 the rank for each "push".
2. The number of points assigned depends on the rank you gave to your winning picks. If you chose only one correct pick but assigned rank twelve (12) to that pick, you are doing better than the person who chose three (3) correct picks , but assigned ranks one (1), three (3) and five (5) to those picks. Total possible points available depends on the number of games played that week.
3. Players who fail to return their picks will receive 0 points for that week. They will no longer be eligible for the lowest cumulative score prize. Nor will that week be counted for the lowest single week award. They are still eligible to win the lowest single week award with entries in other weeks.
4. The player with the highest score wins that weeks pot. If two or more players are tied for the highest score the total score for the Monday night game is used as a tie-breaker (see Rule B(4) above).
5. Your weekly scores are accumulated for the season (18 weeks). At the end of the season, the "Overall Pot" will be divided as follows:
  - 40% to the highest cumulative score
  - 25% to the second highest cumulative score
  - 10% to the third highest cumulative score
  - 10% to the lowest cumulative score (Note: to be eligible for this prize you must submit an entry all eighteen weeks.)
  - 10% to the median score (person in the exact middle - expect a lot of competition for this one)
  - 5% to the lowest single week score (Note: you must have submitted an entry to be eligible)
  - In the event that players are tied for any prize or prizes, the prize(s) will be divided among the qualifying players.

## THE SURVIVOR POOL

1. The Survivor Pool consists of $3 for each player.
2. Each week, eligible players choose a team for the Survivor Pool. In order to survive and be eligible for the pool the following week your chosen team must win the current week.
3. A team wins when they have a score higher or equal to the score of the team they are playing against, i.e. point spreads are NOT applied.
4. You may not pick the same team twice in the season.
5. Teams that have a Bye week are not available to be picked that week (Duh!).
6. Failure to submit a pick sheet will eliminate you from the Survivor Pool.
7. In the event that there is only 1 player who survives, that player is the winner and the pool is closed.
8. In the event that there are no survivors, then the pool is closed and is split among the survivors of the previous week.
9. The pool will begin on a week where there has been at least 1 survivor.
10. If at the end of 18 weeks there is more than one survivor, those survivors will split the pool.
