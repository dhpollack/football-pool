# Playwright E2E Test Migration Plan

## Migration Overview
Migrating from Puppeteer to Playwright for end-to-end testing with local execution (no Docker).

## ✅ Current Status
- [ ] Playwright installed and configured
- [ ] Existing Puppeteer tests migrated
- [ ] Docker dependency removed
- [ ] All E2E tests passing with Playwright

## Phase 1: Setup and Installation
1. [ ] Install Playwright dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install -D @playwright/test
   npx playwright install
   ```
2. [ ] Create Playwright configuration (playwright.config.ts)
3. [ ] Set up test environment for local execution
4. [ ] Remove Docker-compose dependencies from test scripts

## Phase 2: Test Migration
1. [ ] Migrate `tests/auth-flow.e2e.test.ts` to Playwright
2. [ ] Migrate `tests/registration.puppeteer.test.ts` to Playwright
3. [ ] Migrate `tests/auth.puppeteer.test.ts` to Playwright
4. [ ] Update test helpers and utilities for Playwright API
5. [ ] Remove Puppeteer-specific dependencies

## Phase 3: Configuration and Optimization
1. [ ] Configure Playwright for headless/local execution
2. [ ] Set up proper timeouts and retries
3. [ ] Configure browser contexts and fixtures
4. [ ] Add Playwright-specific best practices
5. [ ] Update test scripts in package.json

## Phase 4: Validation
1. [ ] Run all migrated tests to ensure they pass
2. [ ] Verify test reliability and performance
3. [ ] Ensure proper cleanup and teardown
4. [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility (if needed)

## Files to Create/Modify
- [ ] `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- [ ] `tests/auth.spec.ts` - Migrated auth tests
- [ ] `tests/registration.spec.ts` - Migrated registration tests
- [ ] `tests/auth-flow.spec.ts` - Migrated comprehensive auth flow
- [ ] Update `package.json` scripts for Playwright
- [ ] Remove Docker-compose test dependencies

## Benefits of Playwright Migration
- ✅ Better cross-browser support
- ✅ Built-in auto-waiting and retries
- ✅ Faster test execution
- ✅ More reliable element selectors
- ✅ No Docker dependency for local testing
- ✅ Modern API with better developer experience

## Next Steps
1. Install Playwright dependencies
2. Create basic configuration
3. Start migrating simplest test first
4. Gradually migrate all test suites
5. Remove Puppeteer and Docker dependencies
