# Playwright E2E Test Migration Plan

## Migration Overview
Migrating from Puppeteer to Playwright for end-to-end testing with local execution (no Docker).

## ✅ Current Status
- [x] Playwright installed and configured
- [x] Existing Puppeteer tests migrated
- [x] Docker dependency removed
- [x] Backend test infrastructure configured (in-memory DB)
- [x] Global setup for test data seeding
- [ ] All E2E tests passing with Playwright

## Phase 1: Setup and Installation ✅ COMPLETED
1. [x] Install Playwright dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install -D @playwright/test
   npx playwright install
   ```
2. [x] Create Playwright configuration (playwright.config.ts)
3. [x] Set up test environment for local execution
4. [x] Remove Docker-compose dependencies from test scripts

## Phase 2: Test Migration ✅ COMPLETED
1. [x] Migrate `tests/auth-flow.e2e.test.ts` to Playwright → `tests/auth-flow.spec.ts`
2. [x] Migrate `tests/registration.puppeteer.test.ts` to Playwright → `tests/registration.spec.ts`
3. [x] Migrate `tests/auth.puppeteer.test.ts` to Playwright → `tests/auth.spec.ts`
4. [x] Update test helpers and utilities for Playwright API
5. [x] Remove Puppeteer-specific dependencies

## Phase 3: Configuration and Optimization ✅ COMPLETED
1. [x] Configure Playwright for headless/local execution
2. [x] Set up proper timeouts and retries
3. [x] Configure browser contexts and fixtures
4. [x] Add Playwright-specific best practices
5. [x] Update test scripts in package.json

## Phase 4: Validation
1. [x] Run all migrated tests to identify issues
2. [x] Fix registration endpoint JSON response handling
3. [x] Fix frontend registration error handling
4. [ ] Verify test reliability and performance
5. [x] Ensure proper cleanup and teardown
6. [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility (if needed)

## Files to Create/Modify ✅ ALL COMPLETED
- [x] `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- [x] `tests/auth.spec.ts` - Migrated auth tests
- [x] `tests/registration.spec.ts` - Migrated registration tests
- [x] `tests/auth-flow.spec.ts` - Migrated comprehensive auth flow
- [x] `tests/global-setup.ts` - Global test setup with backend seeding
- [x] Update `package.json` scripts for Playwright
- [x] Remove Docker-compose test dependencies

## Backend Test Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Configure backend to use in-memory SQLite database
- [x] Automatic admin user creation on startup
- [x] Global setup waits for backend readiness
- [x] Test data seeding before test execution
- [x] No Docker required - runs locally with Go

## Benefits of Playwright Migration
- ✅ Better cross-browser support
- ✅ Built-in auto-waiting and retries
- ✅ Faster test execution
- ✅ More reliable element selectors
- ✅ No Docker dependency for local testing
- ✅ Modern API with better developer experience

## Next Steps
1. [x] Install Playwright dependencies
2. [x] Create basic configuration
3. [x] Start migrating simplest test first
4. [x] Gradually migrate all test suites
5. [x] Remove Puppeteer and Docker dependencies
6. [x] Run tests to identify issues: `npm run test:e2e`
7. [x] Fix registration JSON response handling
8. [x] Fix frontend registration error handling
9. [ ] Fix test expectations for authentication flow
10. [ ] Fix duplicate registration test expectations
11. [ ] Fix session management test expectations
12. [ ] Verify all tests pass
